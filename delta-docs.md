# Delta-Docs

Delta Emulator only supports _some_ systems and each one of those systems requires the ROMâ€™s file extension \(for example: `.gba`\) to be a specific extension in order for Delta to recognize the system to which the ROM belongs. To make things easier, the extension is not case-sensitive.

When importing ROMs into Delta, it is suggested that you import it as a `.zip` file. When creating the zip file, be sure to include only the ROM; if you zip a folder with the ROM inside, it will fail to import.

| Game System | Supported Extensions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Game Boy** | `.gb` |
| **Game Boy Color** | `.gbc` , `.sgb` |
| **Game Boy Advance** | `.gba` , `.srl` |
| **Nintendo DS** | `.nds` , `.dsi` , `.srl` |
| **Nintendo / Famicom** | `.nes` , `.nez` , `.fc` , `.fds` |
| **Super Nintendo / Super Famicom** | `.snes` , `.sfc` , `.smc` , `.fig` |
| **Nintendo 64** | `.n64` , `.z64` , `.v64` , `.ndd` |
